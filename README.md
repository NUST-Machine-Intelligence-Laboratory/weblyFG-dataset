### Dataset Briefing

1. The statistics of popular ﬁne-grained datasets and our datasets. “Supervision" means the training data is manually labeled (“Manual”) or collected from the web (“Web”).

![network](asserts/network_architecture.png)

### Installation
After creating a virtual environment of python 3.5, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies

### How to use
The code is currently tested only on GPU
* **Data Preparation**
    - WebFG-496
      
      Download data into PLM root directory and decompress them using
      ```
      tar -xvf web-aircraft.tar.gz
      tar -xvf web-bird.tar.gz
      tar -xvf web-car.tar.gz
      ```
    - WebiNat-5089
      
      Download data into PLM root directory and decompress them using
      ```
      cat web-iNat.tar.gz.part-* | tar -zxv
      ```



* **Source Code**

    - If you want to train the whole network from beginning using source code on the `WebFG-496` dataset, please follow subsequent steps

      - In `Web496_train.sh`
        - Modify `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to proper cuda device id.
        - Modify `DATA` to `web-aircraft`/`web-bird`/`web-car` as needed and then modify `N_CLASSES` accordingly.
      - Activate virtual environment(e.g. conda) and then run the script
          ```
          bash Web496_train.sh

2. The comparison of classification accuracy (%) of benchmarks and our proposed webly supervised baseline Peer-learning on the WebiNat-5089 dataset.

![network](asserts/result2.png)

</div>


3. The comparisons among our Peer-learning model (PLM), VGG-19, B-CNN, Decoupling (DP), and Co-teaching (CT) on sub-datasets Web-aircraft, Web-bird, and Web-car in WebFG-496 dataset. The value on each sub-dataset is plotted in the dotted line and the average value is plotted in solid line. It should be noted that the classification accuracy is the result of the second stage in the two-step training strategy. Since we have trained 60 epochs in the second stage on the basic network VGG-19, we only compare the first 60 epochs in the second stage of our approach with VGG-19
